## The Artsakh Genocide: Key Events

Over the past several years, Azerbaijan has been testing the waters of what the international community considers acceptable. Now, it intends to finish [what the Ottoman Turks started in 1915](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide). This modern-day genocide underscores the failure of western diplomacy.

### Lachin Corridor Blockade

Since December 12, 2022, [Azerbaijan has been blockading the Lachin Corridor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2023/08/08/lachin-corridor-blockade-starves-nagorno-karabakh/), the sole land link connecting Artsakh to Armenia and the rest of the world. Nagorno Karabakh (known to Armenians as *Artsakh*) is a self-declared republic of 120,000 ethnic Armenians in the Caucasus. Initially launched under the false pretext of [environmental activism](https://time.com/6257467/armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh-lachin-environment-icj/), the blockade has now evolved into a coordinated effort to **ethnically cleanse Artsakh**.

### A binding ICJ order, international condemnation, and genocide alerts

The [2020 trilateral ceasefire agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_ceasefire_agreement) signed by Armenia and Azerbaijan is clear about the status of the Lachin Corridor:

> The Lachin Corridor (5 km wide), which will provide a connection between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia while not passing through the territory of Shusha, shall remain under the control of the Russian Federation peacemaking forces. The Republic of Azerbaijan shall guarantee the security of persons, vehicles and cargo moving along the Lachin Corridor in both directions. 

In violation of this agreement, Azerbaijan has been blockading the Lachin Corridor and preventing the safe passage of persons, vehicles, and cargo in both directions.

On February 22, 2023, the International Court of Justice—the UN's highest court—[issued a legally binding ruling](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/180/180-20230222-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf) that orders Azerbaijan to end the blockade and allow free movement of civilians in both directions; Azerbaijan has ignored this order with impunity. So far, the blockade has been condemned internationally by [members of the U.S. Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/108?s=1&r=97), the UN, the European Union, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention, and countless others.

On August 7, 2023, former International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo [wrote a report noting that these actions amount to genocide](https://luismorenoocampo.com/lmo_en/report-armenia/), comparable to war crimes committed in Srebrenica during the Bosnian genocide. On August 18, the Lemkin Institute issued [an active genocide alert for Artsakh](https://www.lemkininstitute.com/active-genocide-alert-1/active-genocide-alert-azerbaijan----in-artsakh-).

### Starvation as a weapon of genocide

Early on in the blockade, Red Cross vehicles were granted intermittent passage to tend to critically ill patients. [As of July 2023](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/azerbaijan-armenia-sides-must-reach-humanitarian-consensus-to-ease-suffering), Azerbaijan is no longer permitting the Red Cross to enter Artsakh:

> Despite persistent efforts, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is not currently able to bring humanitarian assistance to the civilian population through the Lachin corridor or through any other routes, including Aghdam.

As a result of the blockade, food has been severely rationed in Artsakh; miscarriages have nearly tripled, and medical complications have sharply risen. Baby formula, essential hygiene products, and basic food necessities are all in critically short supply. [A convoy of Armenian trucks carrying 360 tons of food](https://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan-blocks-armenian-aid-convoy-/32522087.html) is currently stranded just outside the Lachin Corridor checkpoint; [a French convoy of humanitarian aid](https://en.armradio.am/2023/08/30/french-humanitarian-convoy-banned-from-entering-artsakh/) was similarly barred from entering. On August 15, 2023, photos circulated on social media showing the emaciated body of K. Hovhannisyan, a 40-year-old resident of Artsakh who [died of malnourishment and starvation](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1117440.html). If the blockade is not lifted, nearly 30,000 children will share a similar fate: malnutrition and, eventually, death.

On September 18, 2023, after international pressure mounted, the Red Cross was [finally able to resume delivering supplies to Artsakh via the Lachin Corridor](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/red-cross-sends-humanitarian-convoys-karabakh-first-reopening-since-december-2023-09-18/).

### Azerbaijani propaganda and denial of the genocide

[According to Azerbaijani state propaganda](https://www.politico.eu/article/nagorno-karabakh-armenia-azerbaijan-blockade-checkpoint/), there is no blockade and people are free to move in either direction. This stance was echoed by Azerbaijan's representative to the UN during [the August 16 emergency UNSC meeting](https://media.un.org/en/asset/k14/k1498sf9lh). At the same time, Azerbaijan has proposed transporting its own humanitarian aid via [an alternative land route through the town of Aghdam](https://jam-news.net/baku-offers-road-through-agdam-instead-of-lachin/).

These conflicting narratives raise two important questions:

1. First, if there is no blockade, what is the need for humanitarian aid or an alternative transportation route?
2. Second, if Azerbaijan truly intends to make peace with the Armenians of Artsakh, why did it impose this barbaric blockade in the first place and attempt to starve them into accepting its terms of negotiation?

[Azerbaijan has assured](https://oc-media.org/aliyev-ready-to-offer-amnesty-to-stepanakert-authorities-if-they-dissolve-government-and-parliament/) the citizens of Artsakh that they will be granted amnesty (for what?) if they disband their government and integrate into Azerbaijani society. It does this while [arbitrarily arresting Armenians and illegally abducting them from the ICRC's custody](https://en.armradio.am/2023/07/29/the-arrest-of-a-person-under-the-protection-of-international-humanitarian-law-and-the-icrc-is-a-war-crime-armenian-mfa/) at the Lachin checkpoint.

President Aliyev has one demand for the people of Artsakh: Lay down your arms in exchange for peace guarantees. During the Bosnian Genocide, Ratko Mladic offered the same terms to the Bosnians. When the Bosnians surrendered their weapons, the men were immediately rounded up and massacred; women and children were raped and deported. How can the Armenians of Artsakh trust the very people who [regularly mutilate and behead them](https://azeriwarcrimes.org/atrocities/), violate the fragile ceasefire, and [fire upon civilian farmers](https://asbarez.com/artsakh-farmers-again-targeted-by-azerbaijani-gunfire/)? How can they trust—much less coexist with—the very people who manufactured this humanitarian crisis in the first place?

### Assault on Artsakh

In early September, 2023, Azerbaijan [began massing troops on the border of Artsakh and Armenia](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/09/15/azerbaijani-troops-russian-style-symbols-armenia-border/). [Videos circulating on social media](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw0pkO-MuM-/) showed Azerbaijani military vehicles with special markings carrying a large number of troops towards the Armenian border.

On September 19, 2023, [Azerbaijan launched a large-scale assault on Artsakh with drones and mortars](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/19/azerbaijan-forces-attack-nagorno-karabakh-as-threat-of-new-war-looms), damaging civilian structures, injuring hundreds, killing civilians, and displacing thousands of ethnic Armenians. Much like how President Putin justified his invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as a "[special military operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_conducting_a_special_military_operation)," President Aliyev also claimed that Azerbaijan was conducting an "anti-terrorist military operation." He has vowed to carry out this operation to its end.

## Silence is violence

The UN's [Genocide Convention](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide-convention.shtml) states:

> Importantly, the Convention establishes on State Parties the obligation to take measures to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide, including by enacting relevant legislation and punishing perpetrators, “whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals” (Article IV). That obligation, in addition to the prohibition not to commit genocide, have been considered as norms of international customary law and therefore, binding on all States, whether or not they have ratified the Genocide Convention.

Despite this responsibility, several countries and politicians are morally complicit in this genocide—through inaction, corruption, and their funding of Azerbaijan's petro-dictatorship.

### The European Union

On July 18, 2022, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU, [signed a gas deal with Azerbaijan](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/da/statement_22_4583) to increase imports of Azeri gas in order to compensate for shortages caused by the war in Ukraine. Just a few months later, in November 2022, Azerbaijan [struck a deal to import gas from Russia](https://eurasianet.org/azerbaijans-russian-gas-deal-raises-uncomfortable-questions-for-europe), raising questions about where Europe would be purchasing its gas from.

By increasing its economic dependence on Azerbaijan, the EU has given Azerbaijan the political leverage that it needs to tighten its chokehold on Artsakh. While the EU did deploy a border-monitoring mission to Armenia in January 2023, this has done little to abate Azerbaijan's aggression—in June 2023, the Azerbaijani ambassador to the EU [openly threatened the monitoring mission on Twitter](https://euobserver.com/world/157246); on August 15, 2023, Azerbaijan [fired across the border in the direction of the EU delegates](https://www.politico.eu/article/azerbaijan-armenia-border-gunfire-european-union-observers-verin-shorzha-united-nations-nagorno-karabakh/).

### Russia
This should not come as a surprise in light of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. After the 2020 Artsakh war, Russia [deployed a peacekeeping contingent of 2,000 soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_ceasefire_agreement#Overview) to Artsakh as part of the ceasefire agreement signed by Armenia and Azerbaijan. The peacekeepers have done nothing to maintain peace in the region; they are a symbol of Russia's impotence and dwindling regional influence. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has [repeatedly criticized CSTO member Russia](https://eurasianet.org/tensions-rise-between-armenia-russia) for its inaction in the blockade.

### The United Kingdom
From 2012 to 2014, [Azerbaijan used four British companies to launder $2.9 billion into Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/04/uk-at-centre-of-secret-3bn-azerbaijani-money-laundering-and-lobbying-scheme) to bribe politicians and journalists and discourage criticism of Aliyev's dictatorship. The legacy of this scandal lives on today in the West's reluctance to condemn or sanction Aliyev.

### Germany
[A VICE investigation](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjp73b/azerbaijan-lobbying-germany-angela-merkel-ilham-aliyev) implicated a number of German politicians in an Azerbaijani campaign to bribe European diplomats. Germany has [called for the opening of the Lachin Corridor](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1119141.html), but appeals to reason are not enough to stop dictators from committing genocide.

### Italy
Italy spends more on Azerbaijani exports than any other European country; in 2022 alone, it [imported $17B worth of goods from Azerbaijan](https://tradingeconomics.com/azerbaijan/exports-by-country)—more than eight times as much as Turkey did. Azerbaijan is also a key energy and military partner for Italy—in 2023, Italy signed [a $170M deal to install gas turbines in Azerbaijan](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/italys-ansaldo-energia-signs-$171-mln-gas-turbine-deal-in-azerbaijan) at an electric power plant; in June 2023, [Azerbaijan reached a deal to purchase military aircraft from Italy](https://eurasianet.org/azerbaijan-to-buy-italian-military-aircraft).

Like their German and British counterparts, [some Italian politicians were bribed by Azerbaijan](https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/13628-italian-court-sentences-former-council-of-europe-mp-for-bribery) to paint the country in a positive light.

### Israel
Israel has been [actively arming Azerbaijan with modern weaponry since 2016](https://armenianweekly.com/2023/03/08/israels-massive-supply-of-sophisticated-weapons-to-azerbaijan/) in an attempt to weaken Iran. Azerbaijan's main cargo arline, Silk Way Airlines, [makes regular trips to the Ovda military base in Tel Aviv](https://hetq.am/en/article/159676), where it acquires weapons and other supplies—weapons like the LORA ballistic missiles and kamikaze drones that [Azerbaijan used against Armenians](https://www.csis.org/analysis/air-and-missile-war-nagorno-karabakh-lessons-future-strike-and-defense) during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War.

### Turkey
Denial of the first Armenian genocide is [the official state policy of Turkey](https://www.mfa.gov.tr/the-armenian-allegation-of-genocide-the-issue-and-the-facts.en.mfa). During the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020, Turkey actively armed Azerbaijan in pursuit of [its own geopolitical goals](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-does-turkey%E2%80%99s-pan-turkic-eurasian-pivot-hold-pakistan-201381) of creating a greater Turkic World. In his December 2020 speech at the victory day parade in Baku, President Erdogan appealed to this surging Turkish nationalism and [openly praised the perpetrators of the Armenian genocide](https://44days.info/speech-by-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan/):

> Today the soul of Azerbaijan’s national poet, great fighter Ahmad Javad will rejoice. Today the soul of Nuri Pasha, Enver Pasha, brave soldiers of the Caucasian Islamic Army will rejoice. Today the soul of one of the first Azerbaijani martyrs, Mubariz Ibrahimov, will rejoice. Today is a day of victory and pride for all of us, for the entire Turkic world.

During [the UNSC emergency meeting on August 16, 2023](https://media.un.org/en/asset/k14/k1498sf9lh) concerning the Lachin Corridor, Turkey's representative parroted Azerbaijan's claim that there is no blockade.

### The United States
In 1992, after the first Artsakh war, Congress passed the Freedom Support Act; [Section 907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_907) of this act bans direct U.S. aid to Azerbaijan. In 2001, the Senate amended the act to allow the President to waive Section 907; every single president has exercised this right since then. Since 2001, the U.S. has provided [over $470 million in military aid to Azerbaijan](https://securityassistance.org/security-sector-assistance/).

Since the start of the blockade, President Biden has not issued any statements concerning the blockade or condemned President Aliyev. Biden also did not comment on Azerbaijan's shelling of Artsakh on September 19 while attending the 78th UN General Assembly. [Yuri Kim](https://www.state.gov/biographies/yuri-kim/), Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasian Affairs, [claimed during a hearing](https://twitter.com/ANCA_DC/status/1704239155746680915):

> The United States will not countenance any effort or action, short-term or long term, to ethnically cleanse or commit other atrocities against the Armenian people of Nagorno Karabakh.
