## A second Armenian genocide

Since December 12, 2022, [Azerbaijan has blockaded the Lachin Corridor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2023/08/08/lachin-corridor-blockade-starves-nagorno-karabakh/), the sole land link connecting Nagorno Karabakh to Armenia and the outside world. Nagorno Karabakh (known to Armenians as *Artsakh*) is a self-declared republic of 120,000 ethnic Armenians in the Caucasus; while its status remains disputed, one fact is clear: Azerbaijan is blockading Nagorno Karabakh with the aim of **ethnically cleansing the population by starvation**.

Early on in the blockade, Red Cross vehicles were granted intermittent passage to tend to critically ill patients. [As of July 2023](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/azerbaijan-armenia-sides-must-reach-humanitarian-consensus-to-ease-suffering), Azerbaijan is no longer permitting the Red Cross to enter Nagorno Karabakh.

> Despite persistent efforts, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is not currently able to bring humanitarian assistance to the civilian population through the Lachin corridor or through any other routes, including Aghdam.

On February 22, 2023, the International Court of Justice—the UN's highest court—[ordered Azerbaijan to end the blockade and allow free movement of civilians in both directions](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/180/180-20230222-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf); Azerbaijan has ignored this order with impunity. The blockade is a humanitarian catastrophe that has been condemned internationally by [members of the U.S. Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/108?s=1&r=97), the UN, the European Union, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Red Cross, the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention, and countless others. On August 7, 2023, former International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno Campo [wrote a report noting that these actions amount to genocide](https://luismorenoocampo.com/lmo_en/report-armenia/), comparable to war crimes committed by Ratko Mladić in Srebrenica during the Bosnian genocide.

As a result of the blockade, food has been severely rationed in Nagorno Karabakh; miscarriages have nearly tripled, and medical complications have sharply risen. Baby formula, essential hygiene products, and basic food necessities are all in critically short supply. [A convoy of Armenian trucks carrying 360 tons of food](https://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan-blocks-armenian-aid-convoy-/32522087.html) is currently stranded outside the Lachin Corridor checkpoint, just barely out of reach. On August 15, 2023, K. Hovhannisyan, a 40-year-old resident of Nagorno Karabakh, [died of malnourishment and starvation](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1117440.html); photos of his emaciated body circulated on social media. If the blockade is not lifted, nearly 30,000 children will share a similar fate: malnutrition and, eventually, death.

Over the past several years, Azerbaijan has been testing the waters of what the international community considers acceptable. Now, it intends to finish [what the Ottoman Turks started in 1915](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide). This modern-day genocide underscores the failure of western diplomacy.

## Azerbaijani propaganda and genocide denial

The [trilateral ceasefire agreement of 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_ceasefire_agreement) is clear about the status of the Lachin Corridor:

> The Lachin Corridor (5 km wide), which will provide a connection between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia while not passing through the territory of Shusha, shall remain under the control of the Russian Federation peacemaking forces. The Republic of Azerbaijan shall guarantee the security of persons, vehicles and cargo moving along the Lachin Corridor in both directions. 

And yet, in violation of the ceasefire agreement, the Lachin Corridor has been blockaded for over eight months.

Meanwhile, [according to Azerbaijani state propaganda](https://www.politico.eu/article/nagorno-karabakh-armenia-azerbaijan-blockade-checkpoint/), there is no blockade and people are free to move in either direction; this stance was echoed by Azerbaijan's representative to the UN during [the August 16 emergency UNSC meeting](https://media.un.org/en/asset/k14/k1498sf9lh). At the same time, Azerbaijan has proposed transporting its own humanitarian aid via [an alternative land route through the town of Aghdam](https://jam-news.net/baku-offers-road-through-agdam-instead-of-lachin/). These conflicting narratives raise two important questions:

1. First, if there is no blockade, what is the need for humanitarian aid or an alternative transportation route?
2. Second, if Azerbaijan truly intends to make peace with the Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh, why would it impose this barbaric blockade in the first place and attempt to starve them into submission?

Azerbaijan has assured the citizens of Nagorno Karabakh that they will be "pardoned" if they disband their government and integrate into Azerbaijani society. It does this while [arbitrarily arresting Armenians and illegally abducting them from the ICRC's custody](https://en.armradio.am/2023/07/29/the-arrest-of-a-person-under-the-protection-of-international-humanitarian-law-and-the-icrc-is-a-war-crime-armenian-mfa/).

Much like convicted war criminal Ratko Mladić, President Aliyev has one demand: Lay down your arms in exchange for peace guarantees. When the Bosnians surrendered their weapons, the men were immediately separated and massacred; women and children were raped and deported. How can we expect Armenians to trust people who [regularly mutilate and behead them](https://azeriwarcrimes.org/atrocities/) and violate the fragile ceasefire? How can Armenians trust—much less coexist with—the very people who manufactured this humanitarian catastrophe in the first place?

## Silence is violence

The UN's [Genocide Convention](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide-convention.shtml) states:

> Importantly, the Convention establishes on State Parties the obligation to take measures to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide, including by enacting relevant legislation and punishing perpetrators, “whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals” (Article IV). That obligation, in addition to the prohibition not to commit genocide, have been considered as norms of international customary law and therefore, binding on all States, whether or not they have ratified the Genocide Convention.

Despite this responsibility, several countries and groups of countries are morally complicit in this genocide, either through their inaction or their funding of Azerbaijan's petro-dictatorship.

### The European Union

On July 18, 2022, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU, [signed a gas deal with Azerbaijan](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/da/statement_22_4583) to increase imports of Azeri gas in order to compensate for shortages caused by the war in Ukraine. In November 2022, Azerbaijan [struck a deal to import gas from Russia](https://eurasianet.org/azerbaijans-russian-gas-deal-raises-uncomfortable-questions-for-europe), raising questions about where Europe would be purchasing its gas from. By increasing its economic dependence on Azerbaijan, the EU has given Azerbaijan all of the political leverage that it needs to tighten its chokehold on Nagorno Karabakh. While the EU did deploy a border-monitoring mission to Armenia in January 2023, this has done little to abate Azerbaijan's aggression—in June 2023, the Azerbaijani ambassador to the EU [openly threatened the monitoring mission on Twitter](https://euobserver.com/world/157246); on August 15, 2023, Azerbaijan delivered on its promise and [fired upon the EU delegates](https://www.politico.eu/article/azerbaijan-armenia-border-gunfire-european-union-observers-verin-shorzha-united-nations-nagorno-karabakh/).

### Russia
This should not come as a surprise in light of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. After the 2020 Nagorno Karabakh war, Russia [deployed a peacekeeping contingent of 2,000 soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_ceasefire_agreement#Overview) to Nagorno Karabakh as part of the ceasefire agreement signed by Armenia and Azerbaijan. The peacekeepers have done nothing to maintain peace in the region; they are a symbol of Russia's impotence and dwindling regional influence.

### Israel
Israel has been [actively arming Azerbaijan with modern weaponry since 2016](https://armenianweekly.com/2023/03/08/israels-massive-supply-of-sophisticated-weapons-to-azerbaijan/). To Israel, Armenian lives are dispensible and a means to a geopolitical end: a greatly weakened Iran.

### Turkey
[The official state policy of Turkey](https://www.mfa.gov.tr/the-armenian-allegation-of-genocide-the-issue-and-the-facts.en.mfa) categorically denies that the first Armenian genocide took place. During the December 2020 victory day parade in Baku, President Erdogan [openly praised the perpetrators of the Armenian genocide](https://44days.info/speech-by-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan/) in his speech:

> Today the soul of Azerbaijan’s national poet, great fighter Ahmad Javad will rejoice. Today the soul of Nuri Pasha, Enver Pasha, brave soldiers of the Caucasian Islamic Army will rejoice. Today the soul of one of the first Azerbaijani martyrs, Mubariz Ibrahimov, will rejoice. Today is a day of victory and pride for all of us, for the entire Turkic world.

During [the UNSC emergency meeting on August 16, 2023](https://media.un.org/en/asset/k14/k1498sf9lh) concerning the Lachin Corridor, Turkey parroted Azerbaijan's claim that there is no blockade.

### The United States
In 1992, after the first Nagorno Karabakh war, Congress passed the Freedom Support Act; [Section 907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_907) of this act bans direct U.S. aid to Azerbaijan. In 2001, the Senate amended the act to allow the President to waive Section 907; every single president has exercised this right since then. Since 2001, the U.S. has provided [over $470 million in military aid to Azerbaijan](https://securityassistance.org/security-sector-assistance/).
